# Story 03.05: Define Content Backup and Rollback Process

## Objective

Define a practical backup and rollback workflow for website content regressions so recovery is fast and repeatable.

## Scope

1. Document rollback triggers and recovery decision points for content and metadata regressions.
2. Define backup expectations for key content surfaces (`src/content/*`, `internal-docs/*`, and release-critical config/docs).
3. Add an operator runbook with step-by-step rollback and verification commands.
4. Keep the process compatible with existing git-based workflows and static build validation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Backup/rollback workflow is documented and version-controlled.
- Operators have clear rollback steps and post-rollback validation checks.
- Build and URL stability expectations remain explicit.
