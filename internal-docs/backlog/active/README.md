# Active Backlog Sprint Plan (2026-02-19)

This sprint now shifts from docs productization to discoverability and growth instrumentation.

## Sprint Sequence

### Phase 1: Publishing & Growth Infrastructure
1. **Story 03.05: Define Content Backup and Rollback Process**

## Strategic Risks

- Rollback procedures can become stale if they are not exercised against current build/deploy workflows.
- Recovery guidance must avoid destructive git usage patterns that could affect unrelated in-flight work.

## Iteration Exit Checklist

1. Docs + code updates completed for in-scope stories.
2. Build passes: `npm run build`.
3. Handoff updated: `internal-docs/archive/handoff.md`.
4. Story movement performed: active -> completed.
5. Next cycle prompt refreshed.
