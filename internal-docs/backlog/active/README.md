# Active Backlog Sprint Plan (2026-02-19)

This sprint now shifts from docs productization to discoverability and growth instrumentation.

## Sprint Sequence

### Phase 1: Publishing & Growth Infrastructure
1. **Story 03.01: Add SEO and Social Metadata Baseline**
2. **Story 03.02: Add Website Analytics Event Model**

## Strategic Risks

- SEO metadata gaps can reduce discoverability and share-preview quality on core launch pages.
- Analytics event sprawl can degrade data quality if taxonomy boundaries are not explicit.
- Tracking should remain privacy-conscious and optional to avoid coupling core site rendering to vendor scripts.

## Iteration Exit Checklist

1. Docs + code updates completed for in-scope stories.
2. Build passes: `npm run build`.
3. Handoff updated: `internal-docs/archive/handoff.md`.
4. Story movement performed: active -> completed.
5. Next cycle prompt refreshed.
