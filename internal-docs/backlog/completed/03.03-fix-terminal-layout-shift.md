# Story 03.03: Fix Terminal Layout Shift

## Objective

Prevent layout shifts and text resizing in the adjacent content when the "mission control terminal" component writes content.

## Scope

1. Analyze the `Terminal.astro` component and its layout container on the homepage.
2. Ensure the terminal component has a stable, pre-defined height or use layout techniques (like CSS Grid or fixed dimensions) to prevent it from affecting neighboring elements as content is added.
3. Verify that the text to the left of the terminal does not resize or move during the terminal's "typing" animation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The terminal component does not cause layout shifts in adjacent elements while writing content.
- The text to the left of the terminal remains stable and does not resize.
- The homepage layout remains consistent across different screen sizes while the terminal animation is active.
