# Story 02.01: Wire ProjectAthena Reference Docs Ingestion Strategy

## Objective

Define how product docs from `projectathena/docs` are surfaced or synchronized in this website repo.

## Scope

1. Define source-of-truth ownership per doc domain.
2. Define sync options (manual import, scripted copy, generated references).
3. Define versioning/archive behavior for imported docs.
4. Define risk controls for stale or conflicting docs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A documented ingestion strategy exists in `internal-docs/research/active/` or `internal-docs/developer/`.
- Trade-offs are clearly stated with a recommended default.
- Follow-up implementation tasks are added to backlog.
