# Story 02.04: Implement ProjectAthena Docs Sync Script and Guardrails

## Objective

Implement deterministic docs synchronization from `projectathena/docs` into website docs using the ingestion manifest.

## Scope

1. Implement a sync script that reads manifest mappings and generates website docs content.
2. Attach source trace metadata (`sourceCommit`, `lastSyncedAt`) to generated pages.
3. Add guardrails to prevent manual edits to generated docs.
4. Add validation checks for missing source files and slug collisions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Sync script runs locally and produces deterministic output.
- Generated docs include source trace metadata.
- Validation fails fast on broken mappings or route collisions.
- Build remains successful after generated content updates.

## Out Of Scope

- Scheduling or CI automation of sync runs.
