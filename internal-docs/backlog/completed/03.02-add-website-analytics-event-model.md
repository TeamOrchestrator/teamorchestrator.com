# Story 03.02: Add Website Analytics Event Model

## Objective

Define and implement a minimal analytics event model for product and docs engagement.

## Scope

1. Define event taxonomy for key interactions (CTA clicks, docs navigation, blog engagement).
2. Add instrumentation points in reusable UI surfaces.
3. Document event names, payload shape, and expected semantics.
4. Ensure analytics integration is optional and does not break static build behavior.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Event model is documented and version-controlled.
- Instrumentation is implemented for agreed baseline interactions.
- Build remains successful and URLs remain stable.
