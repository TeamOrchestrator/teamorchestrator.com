# Story 01.01: Establish Docs-As-Code Workflow

## Objective

Create the baseline workflow for authoring, reviewing, and publishing documentation from this repository.

## Scope

1. Define doc lifecycle states (draft, review, published, archived).
2. Define owner/reviewer expectations for each docs section.
3. Add a cycle checklist to keep handoffs consistent.
4. Ensure docs index pages clearly point to canonical sections.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A documented lifecycle exists in `internal-docs/developer/`.
- A checklist exists and is referenced from onboarding.
- Publishing path is clear for docs and blog content.

## Out Of Scope

- Full CI automation for editorial checks.
