# Story 02.03: Establish Docs Ingestion Manifest and Ownership Map

## Objective

Create the ingestion contract that maps Athena source docs to stable website routes with clear ownership metadata.

## Scope

1. Define manifest schema for source path, destination slug, owner, and lifecycle state.
2. Seed manifest entries for the initial curated Athena docs set.
3. Document slug lock policy for published routes.
4. Document ownership/review responsibility for each imported domain.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Manifest file exists and is version-controlled in TeamOrchestrator.com.
- Initial curated mappings are documented and reviewable.
- Ownership map is explicit and references source-of-truth domains.

## Out Of Scope

- Full ingestion automation implementation.
