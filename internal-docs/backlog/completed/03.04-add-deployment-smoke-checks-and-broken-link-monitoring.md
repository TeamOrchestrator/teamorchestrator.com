# Story 03.04: Add Deployment Smoke Checks and Broken-Link Monitoring

## Objective

Add lightweight post-build validation to catch route and link regressions before website changes are handed off.

## Scope

1. Define a baseline smoke-check contract for core routes (`/`, `/blog`, `/docs` and representative detail routes).
2. Add a scriptable check that runs against static output to detect missing pages and broken internal links.
3. Document the smoke-check workflow in developer docs and cycle checklist references.
4. Keep checks optional for local iteration but easy to run in CI.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Smoke-check contract is documented and version-controlled.
- A repeatable command exists to validate core route availability and internal-link integrity.
- Build remains successful and URLs remain stable.
