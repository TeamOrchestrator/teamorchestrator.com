## Manifest Assembly

The lifecycle begins with the **Manifest Engine**, which translates strategic intent into a curated **Flight Manifest**. This manifest defines the specific sequence of **Specialist Designations** (e.g., Bug Scrubber, Reliability Specialist) required for the objective.

## Specialist Assignment

Athena allocates specialists from the **Hangar Roster** based on their high-fidelity technical capabilities. Each specialist is provisioned with a dedicated toolset and injected with the compounded seed context of the mission.

## Mission Relay

Each phase of the mission is governed by a **Relay Path**. Specialists emit traces and results that are compounded by Athena into the "Seed Context" for the next unit in the manifest.

## Final Briefing

Upon completion, the mission generates a comprehensive **Evidence Bundle**, which is archived for human verification by the Flight Director.
