# Team Orchestrator: Marketing & Launch Narrative

## 1. The Target Audience
**The Technical Force Multiplier:** Engineering Managers, CTOs, and Tech Leads who need to scale throughput by partnering with a digital workforce.

## 2. Key Value Propositions
- **The Flight Manifest:** "Athena proposes the optimal manifest for your mission. You approve the specialists, verify their briefings, and initiate the relay."
- **Contextual Wisdom:** "Athena ensures that knowledge moves perfectly between specialists. No context is lost in mission handoffs."
- **Managed Autonomy:** "Human-grade intent meets machine-grade reliability through auditable specialist units."
- **Industrial Precision:** "Deploy specialized designations—Reliability Specialists, Bug Scrubbers, Security Auditors—with absolute observability."

## 3. Competitive Differentiation
- **vs. Autonomous Agents:** Purely autonomous agents are untrustworthy. Team Orchestrator offers **Governed Autonomy** via the Flight Manifest.
- **vs. Copilots:** Copilots are just fancy autocomplete. Athena is a **Strategic Partner** that coordinates complex work across a manifest of specialists.

## 4. Technical Interface Standards
Athena is integrated into the core system identity.

- **CLI:** `athena run` (The direct uplink to the mission controller).
- **State:** `.athena/` (Athena's persistent memory bank).
- **Headers:** `X-Athena-Identity` (Security clearance for the mission relay).

## 5. Roadmap Milestones (Branded)
