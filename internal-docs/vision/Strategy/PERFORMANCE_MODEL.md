# Team Orchestrator: Performance & Fidelity Model

## 1. The Calibration Framework
Team Orchestrator measures both **Machine Efficiency** and **Human Alignment** to provide a holistic "Trust Score."

## 2. Layer 1: Operational Efficiency (Machine Metrics)
- **Resource Intensity:** Token/Cost ratio (Cost-efficiency).
- **Mission Velocity:** Average Time-to-Output.
- **System Stability:** Runtime success vs. provider timeouts.

## 3. Layer 2: Alignment Fidelity (Human Metrics)
- **First-Pass Acceptance:** How often the user clicks "Approve" on the first turn.
- **Re-steering Delta:** The number of follow-up "correction" turns required by the user.
- **Mission Rejection Rate:** Frequency of scrapped tasks.

## 4. The Academy: Pilot Training & Calibration
The Academy is the calibration center where pilots are "trained" based on Flight Director feedback and performance telemetry.

- **Narrative:** Pilots start at a "Baseline Service Record." As they successfully complete missions, their "Fidelity Rating" increases.
- **Optimization Advice:** "You've re-steered Sarah on 'Sprint Documentation' 5 times. Send her to The Academy to update her Skill-Set for automated compliance."
- **Skill-Set Provisioning:** New abilities are provisioned as "Module Upgrades" to a pilot's dossier.

## 5. First Impression: The Mission Audit
When auditing a pilot's work, the Flight Director (User) feels like they are:
1. **Inspecting Logic:** (Machine Telemetry/Proof of Work).
2. **Reviewing Deliverables:** (Professional Output).
3. **Calibrating the System:** (Adjusting the Fidelity Rating to train the pilot).
