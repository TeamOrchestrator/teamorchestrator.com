# Team Orchestrator: Handoff Summary

## 1. Current Trajectory
- **Product Status:** Stage 8 (in progress).
- **Core Vision:** "Mission Control for the Digital Workforce."
- **Positioning:** Moving beyond "generic agents" to **Governed Autonomy** via **Technical Specialist Designations**.

## 2. Strategic Pivot: The Flight Manifest
We have moved from named AI personas (Sarah, Leo, Alex) to a **Manifest-based Assembly** model:
- **The Flight Manifest:** Athena interprets objectives (e.g., "Hotfix") and proposes a curated manifest of specialist units.
- **Key Specialist Designations:** 
    - *Reliability Specialist* (SRE/Performance)
    - *Bug Scrubber* (Debugging/Patching)
    - *Security Auditor* (Governance/Compliance)
- **Workflow:** Intent -> Athena interpretation -> Manifest proposal -> FD Approval -> Manifest launch -> Evidence Bundle.

## 3. Infrastructure Pillars
- **The Hangar:** Central registry for commissioning and provisioning specialists.
- **The Academy:** Calibration center for "Fidelity Ratings" and pilot training/prompt refinement.
- **The Mission Relay:** Secure, auditable context compounding between specialists in the manifest.

## 4. Key Strategic Assets
- **`IDENTITY.md`:** The updated core essence and command structure.
- **`MANIFEST_SAMPLES.md`:** Concrete scenarios (Hotfix, Feature Launch, Security Hardening).
- **`ROADMAP.md`:** The 20-stage "Flight Path" (currently entering Phase 2: Tactical Specialization).

## 5. Next Directive
Transition to the source directory (`~/Source/teamorchestrator.com`) to begin implementing **Phase 2** of the roadmap:
- Formalize the **Manifest Engine** in the backend.
- Create the **Specialist Roster** with distinct toolsets.
- Implement the **Evidence Bundling** logic for mission briefings.
