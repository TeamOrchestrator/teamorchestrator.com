# Handoff Snapshot (2026-02-19, Story 02.04 Complete)

## Current State

- Story `02.04` is complete with deterministic manifest-driven docs sync and generation guardrails.
- Curated Athena reference docs now generate into `src/content/docs/reference/` via a repeatable script flow.
- Build remains stable after generated-doc updates.

## What Changed In This Slice

1. Added sync script: `scripts/sync-projectathena-docs.mjs`.
2. Added npm command: `npm run sync:projectathena-docs`.
3. Implemented fail-fast validations in sync workflow for:
   - missing source files,
   - slug collisions,
   - incomplete owner metadata,
   - non-locked slugs.
4. Implemented generated-doc guardrails:
   - managed file marker (`GENERATED FILE: DO NOT EDIT`),
   - refusal to overwrite non-managed files.
5. Added deterministic source trace metadata in generated frontmatter:
   - `sourcePath`, `sourceCommit`, `lastSyncedAt`, `generatedBy`, `generatedFromManifestId`.
6. Added sync runbook: `internal-docs/developer/projectathena-docs-sync.md`.
7. Added local fixture source docs under `internal-docs/fixtures/projectathena/docs/` for repeatable local validation.
8. Ran sync and confirmed generated outputs in `src/content/docs/reference/*.md`.
9. Validated with `npm run build` (pass) after generation.
10. Completed backlog movement for Story `02.04`.

## Risks

- Fixture-backed local validation confirms script behavior, but production usage still depends on real `projectathena/docs` path availability and content shape.
- Generated docs currently rely on simple frontmatter parsing; upstream format changes (complex YAML) may require parser hardening.

## Follow-Ups / Next Slice

- Execute Story `03.01` from `internal-docs/backlog/active/03.01-add-seo-and-social-metadata-baseline.md`.

# Handoff Snapshot (2026-02-19, Story 02.03 Complete)

## Current State

- Story `02.03` is complete with a version-controlled ingestion manifest, explicit schema, and ownership/slug-lock policy for Athena docs mapping.
- Documentation productization is now ready for Story `02.04` sync-script implementation.

## What Changed In This Slice

1. Added manifest schema: `internal-docs/architecture/projectathena-docs-ingestion-manifest.schema.json`.
2. Added seeded ingestion manifest: `internal-docs/architecture/projectathena-docs-ingestion-manifest.json`.
3. Added ownership map and slug-lock policy: `internal-docs/architecture/projectathena-docs-ingestion-ownership-map.md`.
4. Updated architecture index to surface new ingestion-contract artifacts: `internal-docs/architecture/README.md`.
5. Validated repository build via `npm run build` (pass).
6. Completed backlog movement for Story `02.03`.

## Risks

- Seed mappings currently represent curated contract intent; Story `02.04` must enforce validation against real source paths.
- Reviewer handles are policy placeholders and should be aligned to real team identities during implementation rollout.

## Follow-Ups / Next Slice

- Execute Story `02.04` from `internal-docs/backlog/active/02.04-implement-projectathena-docs-sync-script-and-guardrails.md`.

# Handoff Snapshot (2026-02-19, Story 02.02 Complete)

## Current State

- Website stack: Astro + Tailwind with completed Mission Control UI baseline.
- Story `02.02` is complete with deterministic docs search index generation now part of static build output.
- Search artifact is available at `/docs/search-index.json`.

## What Changed In This Slice

1. Added search index builder logic in `src/lib/docs-search-index.ts`.
2. Implemented static JSON route at `src/pages/docs/search-index.json.ts` (`prerender = true`) to emit the build artifact.
3. Indexed metadata includes title, description, route path, section ordering metadata, and heading metadata (depth 2-3).
4. Added schema and downstream consumption contract docs in `internal-docs/developer/docs-search-index-schema.md`.
5. Linked new schema reference from `internal-docs/developer/README.md`.
6. Validated via `npm run build` and confirmed emitted file `dist/docs/search-index.json`.
7. Completed backlog movement for Story `02.02`.

## Risks

- Schema is intentionally minimal (`schemaVersion: 1`); future ranking features may require explicit backward-compatible schema evolution.
- Heading extraction relies on rendered markdown structure; major markdown parser changes may alter heading slug/text output.

## Follow-Ups / Next Slice

- Execute Story `02.03` from `internal-docs/backlog/active/02.03-establish-docs-ingestion-manifest-and-ownership-map.md`.

# Handoff Snapshot (2026-02-19, Story 01.05 Complete)

## Current State

- Website stack: Astro + Tailwind with Mission Control styling and reusable UI components.
- Story `01.05` is complete with an interactive homepage terminal demo that illustrates managed-autonomy mission flow.
- Core URLs remain stable and build output remains deterministic.

## What Changed In This Slice

1. Added `src/components/Terminal.astro` using Astro + vanilla JS for progressive terminal log playback.
2. Implemented representative mission sequence including:
   - `athena run "Deploy new feature branch"`
   - specialist assignment,
   - mission relay/context compounding,
   - final success status with evidence bundle path.
3. Integrated terminal into homepage hero (`src/pages/index.astro`) as the primary right-column demo surface.
4. Extended `src/styles/global.css` with terminal-specific styling:
   - responsive terminal shell and viewport,
   - selectable output text,
   - animated cursor,
   - reduced-motion fallback behavior,
   - screen-reader utility class and live update support.
5. Validated end-to-end with `npm run build` (pass).
6. Completed backlog movement for Story `01.05`.

## Risks

- Inline script timing is intentionally lightweight, but future enhancements should avoid adding heavy client-side state/hydration in the hero.
- Terminal content is static demo text; if made dynamic later, ensure output remains safe and deterministic during static build.

## Follow-Ups / Next Slice

- Execute Story `02.02` from `internal-docs/backlog/active/02.02-implement-docs-search-index-output.md`.

# Handoff Snapshot (2026-02-19, Story 01.04 Complete)

## Current State

- Website stack: Astro (static output) with Tailwind CSS and a reusable Mission Control component baseline.
- Story `01.04` is complete with shared `Card` and `Button` components adopted across Home, Blog, and Docs surfaces.
- Core routes and URLs remain stable.

## What Changed In This Slice

1. Added reusable UI components: `src/components/Card.astro` and `src/components/Button.astro`.
2. Refactored `src/layouts/Layout.astro` to strengthen Mission Control framing and add explicit monospace-capable brand metadata treatment.
3. Enhanced `src/styles/global.css` with:
   - glassmorphism refinements for header/cards,
   - JetBrains Mono usage for technical labels and code surfaces,
   - subtle blueprint/grid-style background accents.
4. Migrated key templates to component-based composition across:
   - Homepage: `src/pages/index.astro`
   - Blog routes: index, pagination, tag, archive, and post views
   - Docs routes: index and doc detail view
5. Validated via `npm run build` (pass).
6. Completed backlog movement for Story `01.04`.

## Risks

- Added visual treatments (blur, gradients, grid overlays) should be visually QA'd in `npm run dev` for readability and contrast at multiple viewport sizes.
- Homepage is now ready for an interactive terminal, but hydration/animation strategy in Story `01.05` must stay within performance budgets.

## Follow-Ups / Next Slice

- Execute Story `01.05` from `internal-docs/backlog/active/01.05-create-interactive-terminal-demo-for-homepage.md`.

# Handoff Snapshot (2026-02-19, Story 01.03 Complete)

## Current State

- Website stack: Astro (static output) with Tailwind CSS now integrated.
- Story `01.03` is complete, establishing a scalable styling baseline for the Mission Control design system phase.
- Core routes (Home, Blog, Docs) retain stable URLs and build cleanly.

## What Changed In This Slice

1. Installed Tailwind toolchain dependencies (`tailwindcss`, `postcss`, `autoprefixer`) and configured PostCSS.
2. Added `tailwind.config.mjs` with Team Orchestrator brand colors and a Mission Control palette (`mission.bg`, `mission.panel`, `mission.border`, etc.).
3. Replaced monolithic static CSS patterns in `src/styles/global.css` with Tailwind `@tailwind` layers and `@apply`-driven component classes.
4. Preserved and migrated layout/typography class contracts used by Home, Blog, and Docs templates, minimizing route-level churn.
5. Validated end-to-end build success via `npm run build`.
6. Completed backlog movement for Story `01.03`.

## Risks

- Styling currently uses Tailwind utility composition over existing semantic class names; Story `01.04` should continue extracting reusable UI components to reduce class-surface duplication.
- Visual parity is preserved at build level, but subtle spacing/typography drift should be visually QA'd in `npm run dev` before broader design expansion.

## Follow-Ups / Next Slice

- Execute Story `01.04` from `internal-docs/backlog/active/01.04-implement-mission-control-design-system-and-layout-components.md`.

# Handoff Snapshot (2026-02-19, UI/UX Evaluation & Modernization Pivot)

## Current State

- Website stack: Astro (static output).
- Core platform foundation is stable.
- Completed a comprehensive UI/UX evaluation focusing on engineering-leader appeal.
- Shifted immediate focus from documentation ingestion to design system modernization and "Mission Control" visual identity.

## What Changed In This Slice

1. Conducted evaluation of current UI/UX and architectural foundation.
2. Created three new prioritized user stories in `internal-docs/backlog/active/`:
    - `01.03`: Adopt Tailwind CSS for Design Consistency.
    - `01.04`: Implement "Mission Control" Design System & Layout Components.
    - `01.05`: Create Interactive Terminal Demo for Homepage.
3. Updated `internal-docs/backlog/active/README.md` to prioritize the design system modernization phase.
4. Updated `next-agent-seed-prompt.md` to point to Story `01.03` as the next task.

## Risks

- Migrating from `global.css` to Tailwind may cause minor temporary visual regressions if not carefully mapped.
- Interactivity (Terminal Demo) needs to be balanced with performance (LCP/CLS).

## Follow-Ups / Next Slice

- Execute Story `01.03` from `internal-docs/backlog/active/01.03-adopt-tailwind-css-for-design-consistency.md`.

# Handoff Snapshot (2026-02-19, Story 02.01 Complete)

## Current State

- Website stack: Astro (static output).
- Story `02.01` is complete with a documented ingestion strategy for `projectathena/docs`.
- Follow-up implementation tasks for manifest and sync automation are now added to active backlog.

## What Changed In This Slice

1. Added strategy artifact: `internal-docs/research/active/projectathena-docs-ingestion-strategy.md`.
2. Defined source-of-truth ownership by documentation domain.
3. Compared sync options (manual import, scripted copy with manifest, generated references) with trade-offs.
4. Recommended default model: scripted copy with manifest, plus selective link-out.
5. Defined versioning/archive behavior and stale/conflict risk controls.
6. Added follow-up stories `02.03` and `02.04` to active backlog.
7. Completed backlog movement for Story `02.01`.

## Risks

- Ingestion policy is documented but not yet enforced by implementation/automation.
- Without manifest and sync guardrails (Stories `02.03`/`02.04`), drift risk remains operationally present.

## Follow-Ups / Next Slice

- Execute Story `02.02` from `internal-docs/backlog/active/02.02-implement-docs-search-index-output.md`.

# Handoff Snapshot (2026-02-19, Story 01.02 Complete)

## Current State

- Website stack: Astro (static output).
- Story `01.02` content-operations standards are now established.
- Contributors now have canonical templates and QA checks for docs/blog publishing quality.

## What Changed In This Slice

1. Added frontmatter templates and metadata/naming conventions in `internal-docs/developer/docs-as-code-workflow.md`.
2. Expanded `internal-docs/developer/cycle-checklist.md` with pre-publish quality checks (headings, links, summaries, route validation).
3. Added published docs guide at `/docs/content-templates-and-qa/` backed by `src/content/docs/content-templates-and-qa.md`.
4. Updated docs index canonical operations links to include the new templates/QA page.
5. Seeded blog metadata consistency by explicitly adding `draft: false` to `src/content/blog/introducing-team-orchestrator.md`.
6. Completed backlog movement for Story `01.02`.

## Risks

- QA checks are documented but still manually enforced (no CI lint automation yet).

## Follow-Ups / Next Slice

- Execute Story `02.01` from `internal-docs/backlog/active/02.01-wire-projectathena-reference-docs-ingestion-strategy.md`.

# Handoff Snapshot (2026-02-19, Story 01.01 Complete)

## Current State

- Website stack: Astro (static output).
- Docs-as-code baseline is now established for this repository.
- Canonical operational docs are defined in `internal-docs/developer/docs-as-code-workflow.md` and `internal-docs/developer/cycle-checklist.md`.
- Public docs index now points to operations baselines via `/docs/docs-operations-workflow/` and `/docs/cycle-checklist/`.

## What Changed In This Slice

1. Defined lifecycle states and ownership expectations for docs/blog publishing.
2. Added a repeatable per-cycle checklist and linked it from onboarding.
3. Clarified publishing flow for docs and blog content in both repository docs and docs site content.
4. Updated docs index surfaces to point to canonical operational guidance.
5. Completed backlog movement for Story `01.01`.

## Risks

- Checklist discipline is still manual (no CI enforcement yet).
- Metadata quality can drift until Story `01.02` template standards are implemented.

## Follow-Ups / Next Slice

- Execute Story `01.02` from `internal-docs/backlog/active/01.02-define-content-templates-and-qa-checklist.md`.

# Handoff Snapshot (2026-02-19, Website Development Cycle Kickoff)

## Current State

- Website stack: Astro (static output).
- Core platform pages present:
  - Marketing homepage
  - Blog index/post routes
  - Tag and archive routes
  - Docs index/doc routes
- Stage alignment: Team Orchestrator Stage 8 in progress.
- This handoff established the website development-cycle operating system.

## What Changed In This Slice

1. Seeded cycle management docs for this repository.
2. Created implementation planning baseline for website stages.
3. Created active backlog kickoff stories for the next implementation slices.
4. Added seed prompt to drive the next agent cycle.
5. Added enhanced website roadmap under `internal-docs/backlog/roadmap/roadmap.md`.

## Risks

- Documentation and website code can drift if cycle handoff rules are not consistently followed.
- Early roadmap breadth may over-expand scope without explicit phase boundaries.

## Follow-Ups / Next Slice

- Execute Story `01.01` from `internal-docs/backlog/active/01.01-establish-docs-as-code-workflow.md`.
