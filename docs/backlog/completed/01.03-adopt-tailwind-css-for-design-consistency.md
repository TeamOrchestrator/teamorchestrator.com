# Story 01.03: Adopt Tailwind CSS for Design Consistency

## Objective

Replace the monolithic `global.css` with Tailwind CSS to enable a scalable, component-driven design system.

## Scope

1. Install and configure Tailwind CSS in the Astro project.
2. Define a custom theme in `tailwind.config.mjs` using existing brand colors and adding a "Mission Control" color palette.
3. Migrate basic layout and typography styles from `global.css` to Tailwind utility classes or `@apply` directives.
4. Verify that existing pages (Home, Blog, Docs) remain visually consistent after migration.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Tailwind CSS is successfully integrated and functional during `npm run dev` and `npm run build`.
- `global.css` is significantly reduced or eliminated.
- Brand colors and spacing scales are formalized in `tailwind.config.mjs`.
- No visual regressions in core page layouts.
