# Story 01.04: Implement "Mission Control" Design System & Layout Components

## Objective

Evolve the site's visual identity into a "Mission Control" aesthetic that resonates with engineering leaders.

## Scope

1. Implement a "Glassmorphism" effect for the sticky header and card components using Tailwind.
2. Introduce a high-precision monospace font (e.g., JetBrains Mono) for technical labels and command snippets.
3. Add subtle background grid patterns or blueprint-style line accents to main sections.
4. Refactor `Layout.astro` and create reusable `Card.astro` and `Button.astro` components using the new design system.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Site features a cohesive, "engineered" aesthetic with improved depth and contrast.
- Components are consistently applied across the home, blog, and docs pages.
- Navigation header uses `backdrop-filter` for a modern, layered feel.
- Technical metadata and code snippets use the designated monospace font.
