# Story 01.05: Create Interactive Terminal Demo for Homepage

## Objective

Demonstrate the "Team Orchestrator" workflow through a compelling, interactive terminal component.

## Scope

1. Create a `Terminal.astro` (or React/Vue if needed, but prefer Astro/Vanilla) component that simulates a CLI session.
2. Script a representative "Mission Sequence":
    - `athena run "Deploy new feature branch"`
    - Simulated log output showing specialist assignment, mission relay, and context compounding.
    - Final success state with evidence bundle path.
3. Integrate the Terminal component into the Hero section of the homepage.
4. Ensure the component is accessible and responsive.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Interactive terminal is functional and visible in the Hero section.
- The simulated mission sequence clearly illustrates the product's value proposition.
- Animation is smooth and doesn't interfere with page performance (LCP/CLS).
- Text in the terminal is selectable and accessible.
