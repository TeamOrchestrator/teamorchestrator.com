# Active Backlog Sprint Plan (2026-02-19)

This sprint advances the website content-operations baseline after Story 01.01 completion.

## Sprint Sequence

### Phase 1: Docs-As-Code Operations Foundation
1. **Story 01.02: Define Content Templates and QA Checklist**

### Phase 2: Documentation Productization
2. **Story 02.01: Wire ProjectAthena Reference Docs Ingestion Strategy**
3. **Story 02.02: Implement Docs Search Index Output**

### Phase 3: Publishing & Growth Infrastructure
4. **Story 03.01: Add SEO and Social Metadata Baseline**
5. **Story 03.02: Add Website Analytics Event Model**

## Strategic Risks

- Content drift between `projectathena` docs and website docs if ingestion/update policy is unclear.
- Editorial inconsistency until template and QA standards are added.
- Search/index quality may degrade if metadata standards are not enforced.

## Iteration Exit Checklist

1. Docs + code updates completed for in-scope stories.
2. Build passes: `npm run build`.
3. Handoff updated: `docs/archive/handoff.md`.
4. Story movement performed: active -> completed.
5. Next cycle prompt refreshed.
