Pure autonomous "autopilot" systems can move quickly, but they almost always fail when confronted with the realities of production: auditability, policy control, and deterministic logic. 

Team Orchestrator is built around the principle of **Managed Autonomy**. We don't hope for the right outcome; we govern the process through a strict command structure:

- **Athena** recommends and coordinates the flight plan.
- **Specialist Units** execute within secure boundaries.
- **The Flight Director** (You) maintains strategic veto and approval at every step.

This command loop is the only way to achieve high-velocity execution without sacrificing systemic integrity. If you aren't governing your agents, you aren't ready for the autonomous era.
