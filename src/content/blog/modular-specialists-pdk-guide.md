Generalist agents are a trap. They are shallow in their execution and prone to hallucination when tasked with complex, specialized engineering problems. 

At Team Orchestrator, we advocate for **Specialist Units**. These are narrowly-scoped, high-performance agents designed for one mission: excellence in a single domain.

## The Plugin Development Kit (PDK)

Our PDK allows engineers to architect custom specialists that plug directly into the Athena control plane. Whether you're building a "Security Auditor," an "SRE Liaison," or a "Documentation Engineer," the PDK provides the framework for governed autonomy.

## Three Pillars of Specialist Engineering

1. **Deterministic Boundaries:** Use the PDK to define exactly what tools and context a specialist can access. No mission drift, no unapproved operations.
2. **Standardized Handouts:** Specialists don't just "output text"—they produce mission-grade deliverables. The PDK enforces structured output that Athena can distill and compound.
3. **Sandboxed Execution:** Every specialist runs within a secure, policy-aware environment, ensuring that a failure in one unit does not compromise the entire workforce.

## From Agents to Units

By shifting from generalist agents to specialist units, you improve reliability, reduce token overhead, and create a workforce that can be predictably orchestrated. The PDK is your interface for building the specialists your mission requires.
