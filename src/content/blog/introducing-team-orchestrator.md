Team Orchestrator is the orchestration layer between strategy and execution for AI-assisted teams.

Athena coordinates specialist agents, carries context between missions, and keeps decision authority with humans.

This site now supports a file-based blog and docs system so we can ship updates fast and keep technical guidance close to the product story.
