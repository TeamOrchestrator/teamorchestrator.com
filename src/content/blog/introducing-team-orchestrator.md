The era of "black-box" AI agents is over. For engineering leaders, experimental prompting is no longer enough to build production-grade workflows. 

Team Orchestrator is the mission-critical governance layer between strategy and execution. 

By positioning the human as the **Flight Director**, we ensure that **Athena**—our core orchestrator—coordinates specialists with absolute precision. Our architecture is built to carry high-density context across every mission, keeping decision authority exactly where it belongs: with the engineering lead.

This site is our command surface for sharing the technical standards, operational workflows, and product trajectory of Team Orchestrator. Welcome to Managed Autonomy.
