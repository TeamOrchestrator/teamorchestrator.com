## Positioning

Team Orchestrator is the **Kubernetes of AI Agents**: a control plane that turns experimental prompting into reliable operational workflows.

## Why teams choose it

- Collaborative intelligence with human override.
- Context compounding across specialist handoffs.
- Industrial reliability with auditability and policy controls.

## Current status

Team Orchestrator is currently in **Stage 8 (in progress)** with focus on control-plane/API contract integrity and lock-guarded state changes.
