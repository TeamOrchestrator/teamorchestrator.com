## Positioning

Team Orchestrator is the **governance layer for the autonomous era**. We transform fragile AI prompting into mission-critical, deterministic workflows.

## The Managed Autonomy Advantage

- **The Flight Director Model:** Human-in-the-loop strategy with machine-in-the-loop execution.
- **Context Compounding:** Proprietary intelligence relay that eliminates agentic drift.
- **Industrial Reliability:** Built-in auditability, policy-aware execution, and full-stack observability.

## Current Trajectory

Team Orchestrator is currently in **Stage 8 (in progress)**. Our focus is on perfecting the control-plane API contracts and ensuring mission state changes are handled with absolute atomic integrity.
