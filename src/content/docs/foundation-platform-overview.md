## Positioning

Team Orchestrator is the **governance layer for the autonomous era**. We transform fragile AI prompting into mission-critical, deterministic workflows.

## The Managed Autonomy Advantage

- **The Flight Director Model:** Human-in-the-loop strategy with machine-in-the-loop execution.
- **Context Compounding:** Proprietary intelligence relay that eliminates agentic drift.
- **Industrial Reliability:** Built-in auditability, policy-aware execution, and full-stack observability.

## Current Trajectory

Team Orchestrator has transitioned into **Phase 2: Tactical Specialization (Stages 9-12)**. We are shifting from "generic agents" to a **Manifest-based Assembly** model, where specialized units are curated for specific mission objectives.

- **Manifest Engine:** Athena-driven assembly of specialist units (e.g., Bug Scrubber, Reliability Specialist).
- **Core Specialist Roster:** High-fidelity technical designations with distinct toolsets and KPIs.
- **Evidence Bundling:** Automated "flight recorders" providing full-trace auditability for every mission.
